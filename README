NIMH Labs Rosebush

NIMH Labs Rosebush is the new backend that will run NIMH Labs.com, 
RaddTeam.com and KidRadd.Org. Maybe Interesting Times Magazine as well 
depending on how things work.

Rosebush is mostly designed to be a variant based setup. That is--in its 
current design, each different addition will be in its own git branch.
Allowing for custom systems to be much better.


Rosebush itself, as a base, is more a platform and framework for web 
content to be posted.

Features I plan to include, at least into the base:
 * OpenId/Twitter/Facebook/Google/Yahoo! based login system
 * Extensive tagging system. Both Controller, Resource Identifier and Tags 
   are used for reference.
 * The ability to switch between RSS, Atom, Postscript, RDF, HTML5, XHTML2
   HTML2, JSON and Timothy.lisp
 * Joke skins, such a TimeCube, Geocities, JeffK, etc., and joke filters 
   that allow for a B1FF! type look at the page content.
 * Translate us! Feature. Generally a system that stores a session type 
   system that will automatically translate into your preferred language. 
   Some browsers send a header which suggests a language--we can look for 
   this.
 * Digg! and Stumbler based posting type setups. The login systems will 
   generally handle all the other automatically suggestion type system 
   for the most part.
 * Favourite system. Stores this as a page you liked, and posts in onto 
   whatever login account system you are using.
 * Linked accounts... access the same stuff based on any login type 
   account.
 * Skinable type system.
